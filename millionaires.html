      <h2>The Millionaires</h2>
      <p>Andy and Lee met in 1999 where they studied performing arts at Hull College (Riley). During that time they became friends and often would sit around playing guitars and singing. They both had a great love for The Beatles and harmonies, and this is base on which The Millionaires play today. It was in February 2008 that Lee and Andy did their first gig together.</p>
      <p>After a brief catch up (with guitars) they played at The Duke Of Cumberland in Cottingham and Avenue was born! Lee and Andy played under this name for almost five years before changing to The Millionaires in 2013. Lee and Andy have played all around the country, from pubs to restaurants to nightclubs. They've had the pleasure of sharing many couples wedding days along with people's birthdays and festivals. Two lads, two guitars, two voices, lots of singing, harmonies, dancing and partying! Lee and Andy are, The Millionaires.</p>
